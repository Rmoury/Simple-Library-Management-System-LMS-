# Simple-Library-Management-System-LMS-
This Java-based Library Management System (LMS) offers an uncomplicated solution for
book management within libraries. It consists of two main classes: Book and Library. The
Book class represents individual books with attributes such as bookName, authorName,
publication, and price. The Library class represents the library as a whole, with attributes
including libraryName, libraryAddress, pinCode, and a list of books. The project provides
a basic console-based user interface for operations like adding, removing, updating, and
retrieving books. It serves as a foundational example for beginners learning Java
programming and simple data management concepts..
